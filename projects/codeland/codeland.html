          Product Concept
        </p>
        <p>
          A platform for kids to learn and build things with code, using RPG game mechanics to encourage lesson progression.
          The familiar gradually unlocking map is perfect for pacing out discrete coding concepts and more challenging goals.
          Side quests, NPCs, customizing a character, and inventory are great for allowing kids to explore and choose their style of learning.
          <br><br>
          Inspired by the kids I met while working at Hack, I saw that kids are motivated to learn coding, but there is a huge gap between learning a bit of Scratch and learning enough code to achieve their ideas.

      Lessons lead to a more ambitious project to unlock. The map serves as motivation, as well as spatially organizes related coding concepts.
      <br><br>
      Certain concepts need to be learned before others, but the map also allows freedom. You can choose to go to the next lesson, or choose to play a challenge game.
      <br><br>
      The map also holds navigation for places like the player's custom home, shop, and marketplace.

      There will be many different types of games and activities to relate coding to a wide range of subjects.
      <br><br>
      For example, a word puzzle game is a great way to learn string functions, and builds writing skills.
