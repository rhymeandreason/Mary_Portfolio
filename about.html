          I'm a product designer and technologist.
          <br>
          I've spent 10 years designing for emerging technologies. Most recently, my domain area has been in VR/AR and data visualization.<br><br>
          <!--
          I’ve worked on museum exhibits, 3D printing, fashion, VR, coding for kids, tools for artists and tools for scientists.
        -->Having designed launch products for startups as well as larger companies like Oculus and Amazon, I’m very familiar with early stage ambiguity. I’ve had plenty of practice uncovering unknowns, asking hard questions, and balancing scrappy progress with thorough testing.
          <br><br>

          While technology is always an inspiration, as a designer I'm often the advocate of the human side of the experience.
          Long-term adoption is driven by usefulness, whether in work, daily tasks, or self-expression.
<!--
          I especially enjoy unique challenges where design and engineering are tightly interwoven.

          Generally, I thrive on small collaborative teams, and value having autonomy to work toward novel solutions.
          <br>

          <br><br>
          I'm based in the SF Bay area.

      <div class="six columns">
        <h5 class="title">What is your design process?</h5>
        <p>
          <!--
          I’m flexible about working with different people and teams, and sometimes progress doesn’t happen in linear order.
        -->
          Here are some more words about how I approach working on teams.
        <br><br>
        <b>Learn</b><br>
        <!--
        I try to learn as much about the product and people using it as I can.
        -->
        Where do people get stuck? What details bring joy and understanding?
        Where is the technology going? What are ideas that have been on the backburner?
        What are our own biases in being technology builders?
        <!--
        In addition to user research and user feedback, I do domain research and strive to understand the technology and where it's going. I listen to team members, look for ideas that have been on the backburner, and try to find the right questions to ask.
-->
        <br>
        A lot of my work is finding the right questions to ask.

        <br><br>

        <b>Make & Communicate</b><br>
        User flow? Personas? Prototype? Presentation? Play test? Sometimes the road to the solution is to find the right method to explore the problem.
        <br><br>

        <b>Simplify</b><br>
        Is there a simpler way to approach a problem? Can a complex feature set be untangled into smaller addressable parts? Do we really need this feature? What is the point of view of the user?
        <!--
        Or to get team members to agree to not add another feature. Or to just condense 3 button clicks into 1 and give more hierarchy to common features.
        -->Finding the small ways to simplify leads to larger overall improvements and lets the core concepts shine.
        <br><br>
        <!--
        <b>Collaborate</b><br>
        It’s nice to have someone to figure things out together.
        Since I’ve also often been the solo designer on a team or a complex workflow, I also find ways to simplify my job. I don’t feel the need to own every design decision—I welcome having an art director, product manager, or engineer as a collaborator.
        <br><br>
        -->
        <b>Iterate</b><br>
         When dealing with unknown complexity or new technologies, breaking up the problem scope into manageable chunks gives everyone time to think and a framework to track progress.
        <br><br>
        <b>Momentum</b><br>
        Momentum = Speed X Trust<br>
        I’ve found this magic on more than one team, where once everyone gets comfortable working  together, work can happen very quickly because an idea can be bounced around among team members and improved.  User experience is not simply designed, it is a collaboration between everyone working on a project to take action on improvements and innovations.
        Momentum means making decisions from trying prototypes instead of debating in meetings. Momentum means empowering each other to try out an idea instead of just talking about it.
        Some teams already have this culture, other teams have to uncover it. I’ve found that the greatest contribution I can make as an individual is for my personal design process to build toward a culture of momentum.
