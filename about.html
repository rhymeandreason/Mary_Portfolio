          I'm a product designer working at the intersection of emerging tech and UX.
          <br><br>
          I've been designing engaging user experiences for over 10 years, working between games, creative tools, and innovative consumer apps. My specialties are AR and VR, and distilling complicated mechanics into elegant UI.
          <!--
          I’ve worked on museum exhibits, 3D printing, fashion, VR, coding for kids, tools for artists and tools for scientists.
        I’ve had plenty of practice uncovering unknowns, asking hard questions, and balancing iterative progress with reaching for the north star.
          -->
          <br><br>

          While technology is always an inspiration, as a designer I'm often the advocate of the human side of the experience.
          I strive for creating clarity out of complexity, mindfulness about accessibility, and bridging the divide between different user groups.
          I love working with a collaborative team that strives for a high bar of creative and technical craft.
<!--
          Long-term adoption is driven by context and purpose.
          I especially enjoy unique challenges where design and engineering are tightly interwoven.

          Generally, I thrive on small collaborative teams, and value having autonomy to work toward novel solutions.
          <br>

          <br><br>
          I'm based in the SF Bay area.

          I've been fortunate to work with lovely people at Industrial Light & Magic, Oculus, and Amazon. Let's chat!

        <h5 class="title">What is your design process?</h5>
        <p>
          <!--
          I’m flexible about working with different people and teams, and sometimes progress doesn’t happen in linear order.
        -->
          Here are some more words about how I approach working on teams.
        <br><br>
        <b>Learn</b><br>
        <!--
        I try to learn as much about the product and people using it as I can.
        -->
        Where do people get stuck? What details bring joy and understanding?
        Where is the technology going? What are ideas that have been on the backburner?
        What are our own biases in being technology builders?
        <!--
        In addition to user research and user feedback, I do domain research and strive to understand the technology and where it's going. I listen to team members, look for ideas that have been on the backburner, and try to find the right questions to ask.
-->
        <br>
        Find the right questions to ask, and the solution will follow.

        <br><br>

        <b>Make + Communicate + Iterate</b><br>
        User flow? Personas? Prototype? Presentation? Play test? Create a space to think about the problem and create artifacts that facilitate team feedback. When dealing with unknown complexity or new technologies, breaking up the problem scope into manageable chunks gives a framework to track progress.
        <br><br>

        <b>Simplify</b><br>
        Is there a simpler way to approach a problem? Can a complex feature be untangled into smaller addressable parts? Do we really need this feature? What is the point of view of the user?
        <!--
        Or to get team members to agree to not add another feature. Or to just condense 3 button clicks into 1 and give more hierarchy to common features.
      -->The small ways to simplify leads to larger overall improvements and lets the core concepts shine.
<!--
        <br><br>

        <b>Bridge Cultural Divides</b><br>
        Designing for AR/VR has always required merging expertise from people who build technology platforms and hardware, and people who create content, stories, and tools. As the technology matures into applications for different industries, building understanding between technologists and people from science, manufacturing, construction, education, medicine is a priority. I've worked with a range of different people and teams, and found that bringing together different perspectives leads to a stronger product.
-->
        <br><br>
        <b>Momentum</b><br>
        Momentum = Speed X Trust<br>
        I’ve found this magic on more than one team, where once everyone gets comfortable working  together, work can happen very quickly because an idea can be bounced around among team members and improved.  User experience is not simply designed, it is a collaboration between everyone working on a project to take action on improvements and innovations.
        Momentum means making decisions from trying prototypes instead of debating in meetings. Momentum means empowering each other to try out an idea instead of just talking about it.
        Some teams already have this culture, other teams have to uncover it. I’ve found that the greatest contribution I can make as an individual is for my personal design process to build toward a culture of momentum.
